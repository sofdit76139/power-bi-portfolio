## Outs Reporting
### Outs Mobile
Outs (items with no inventory on the shelf that have a bin label) are scanned in on a weekly basis into Excel 365. Those reports are then synced with the respective data flow several times a day. The floor staff can see on their RF gun what is in stock that they have scanned as "out", and where it is located in backstock.
### Outs Manager
High-level overview for the respective managers, giving a last week/week before last comparison, plus an overview over items with no location listed in the system, and a 90-day overview for the department. Also listed are "repeat offenders", AKA items we can't seem to keep on the shelf.
